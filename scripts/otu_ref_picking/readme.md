# OTU Ref Picking

This script will pick reference OTUs to use as centroids for OTU clustering from amplicons.

It will also generate multiple sequence alignments and trees from the reference OTUs.

It is intended to be used in combination with the Illumina pipeline in order to generate
datasets that are suitable for analysis using PhyloSeq.

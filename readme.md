# Lederhosen

Cluster raw Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon data to generate OTUs.

### About

- Lederhosen is a project born out of the Triplett Lab at the University of Florida.
- Lederhosen is designed to be a fast and simple method of clustering 16S rRNA amplicons sequenced
using paired and non-paired end short reads such as those produced by Illumina (GAIIx, HiSeq and MiSeq).
- Lederhosen uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
- Lederhosen is free and open source under the [MIT open source license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php/).
- Except for USEARCH which requires a license, Lederhosen is available for commercial use.

## How do I get Lederhosen?

0. Obtain & Install [USEARCH](http://www.drive5.com/) (32bit is fine for non-commercial use)
2. Get a copy of [TaxCollector](http://github.com/audy/taxcollector)
3. Install Lederhosen by typing:

    `sudo gem install lederhosen`
4. Check installation by typing `lederhosen`. You should see some help text.

## Features

- Sequence trimming (paired-end Illumina).
- Parallel, referenced-based clustering to TaxCollector using USEARCH
- Generation and filtering of OTU abundancy matrices.

## How do I use Lederhosen?

Lederhosen is just a convenient wrapper for UCLUST and BLAT with some scripts for quality filtering, de-noising of data as well as creation of nice tables. It is similar to QIIME but meant for paired-end Illumina data rather than single-end 454. The basic lederhosen pipeline consists of: trimming, joining, sorting, filtering, clustering, more filtering, and output generation (OTU tables, representative reads, reads by cluster, and taxonomic descriptions for clusters). See the example pipeline in `pipeline.sh`.

## Tasks

Lederhosen is invoked by typing `lederhosen [TASK]`

### Trim Reads

Trim (Illumina) reads using quality scores. Output will be a directory of fasta files. Reads can optionally be gzipped.

    lederhosen trim --reads_dir=reads/*.txt --out_dir=trimmed/

The trimming process will reverse complement the "right" pair so that both reads are in the forward orientation.

### Create Database

Create UDB database required by usearch from TaxCollector

```bash
lederhosen make_udb \
	--input=taxcollector.fa \
	--output=taxcollector.udb
```

### Cluster Reads using USEARCH

Cluster reads using USEARCH. Output is a uc file.

```bash
lederhosen cluster \
	--input=trimmed/*.fasta \
	--identity=0.95 \
	--output=clusters_95.uc \
	--database=taxcollector.udb
```
### Generate OTU table(s)

Create an OTU abundance table where rows are samples and columns are clusters. The entries are the number of reads for that cluster in a sample.

```bash
lederhosen otu_table \
	--clusters=clusters_95.uc \
	--prefix=otu_table \
	--level=domain phylum class order family genus species
```

This will create the files:

    otu_table.domain.csv, ..., otu_table.species.csv

### Get representative sequences

You can get the representative sequences for each cluster using the `get_reps` tasks. This will extract the representative sequence from
the __database__ you ran usearch with. Make sure you use the same database that you used when running usearch.

    lederhosen get_reps --input=clusters.uc --database=taxcollector.fa --output=representatives.fasta

You can get the representatives from more than one cluster file using a glob:

    lederhosen get_reps --input=*.uc --database=taxcollector.fa --output=representatives.fasta
